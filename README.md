## Project Overview:

EthScan is an innovative tool for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, providing a convenient way to track events and obtain real-time data. 
This project allows users to receive up-to-date information from the blockchain by connecting their wallet or subscribing to real-time events.

Open [https://eth-scan-ryzhaknodes-projects.vercel.app/account) with your browser to see the result.

## Key Features:

- Wallet Tracking: Connect your own wallet and gain access to transaction history, account balance, and other crucial data.

- When you connect your wallet, you will be able to access all information about your assets on the Ethereum Blockchain.

- My favorite page is the Screener page, where you can observe real-time transactions on the Ethereum Blockchain. The page updates every 5000ms, providing you with the most current information. Currently, you can track transactions for two tokens: USDT and USDC. Simply input the desired token limit value to customize your viewing experience.

## Additional Information:

- In addition to the frontend functionalities, I've also implemented a backend for authentication using Node.js and MongoDB as the database in this project. However, please note that this backend stage is still in the development and conceptualization phase. I am actively working on introducing more exciting features and enhancing the backend functionalities.
